# local-spotify-api
Allows you to interact with spotify with a web API.

## What does it solve ?

Do you want to integrate spotify with any other tool ?

Well, you can't because of recent decisions, removing the web based API.

This tool "fixes" that by interacting with still present APIs to merge into web based API.

Secured through simple Basic HTTP Auth, you can now controle the music from anything.

## How does it work ?

There are multiple "backends"

# Support
- [x] Linux
  - using dbus
- [ ] MacOS (ongoing)
  - using applescript
- [ ] Windows (not planned for now)
